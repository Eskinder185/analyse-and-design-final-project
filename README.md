# Data Structures and Algorithms Portfolio

## Project Description

This repository contains my submissions for two projects focusing on data structures and algorithms as part of my Computer Science program. The code demonstrates my understanding and application of linked lists, maps, sorting algorithms, and efficient data handling.

### Files Included
- **ProjectTwo.cpp**: Implements a course planner using a map to store course data, allowing users to load, display, and search for courses by their course number.
- **LinkedList.cpp**: Implements a linked list for managing bids, with functionality for appending, prepending, removing, and searching bids. It demonstrates efficient data manipulation in a list structure.

## Reflection

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

In these projects, I developed software for two different purposes: a course planner for managing course information and a bid management system using a linked list. The course planner required sorting and retrieving course details efficiently, while the bid management system required adding, searching, and removing elements in a dynamic list.

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached the problems by choosing data structures based on their efficiency for the required operations. For the course planner, I used a map to enable quick access to course details by course number. For the bid system, I used a linked list to allow flexible insertion and deletion. Understanding data structures was crucial for ensuring that each program was both efficient and easy to maintain.

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

During the projects, I encountered challenges with file handling and structuring the linked list. I reviewed documentation and tested different approaches, such as using loops and pointers effectively. Breaking down the code into smaller functions also helped me troubleshoot and isolate issues more easily.

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on these projects taught me to prioritize both functionality and efficiency in program design. I now consider how different parts of a program interact and how data flows between functions. This approach helps in creating programs that are modular and easier to understand.

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

These projects reinforced the importance of clean and modular code. I used clear naming conventions, added comments, and organized code into well-defined functions. This approach improves readability and makes the code more adaptable for future modifications.
